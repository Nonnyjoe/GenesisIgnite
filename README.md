## What is Genesis Ignite??
Genesis Ignite is a decentralized application (DApp) that functions as a token launchpad. It allows users to participate in presale and launchpad sessions on its platform, using its native token. Genesis Ignite's unique feature is its presale session that allows users to obtain the starting price of the token from the launchpad session, enabling them to buy tokens at a lower price.

The DApp's integrated swapping platform enables users to convert other popular tokens to its native token in a gasless transaction format, making it easier for them to participate in the platform. Additionally, its peer-to-peer system allows users to exchange their native tokens for less popular tokens.

To incentivize users to actively participate in the platform, Genesis Ignite issues NFTs to users based on their level of activeness and trade volume. This gamified experience encourages users to continue using the platform and sets it apart from other launchpads.

Genesis Ignite's ultimate goal is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly experience for users interested in participating in token launches and presales.

<b> Genesis Ignite is a new paradigm in token launchpads. It introduces unique features and functionalities that set it apart from other launchpads, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly experience for users interested in participating in token launches and presales.: </b>
  
  * <b>Presale Session after Launchpad Session</b> - Genesis Ignite offers users the opportunity to participate in presale sessions after the initial launchpad session has ended, allowing them to obtain the starting price of the token and participate in presales and launchpads on the platform using the native token.. 

  * <b>Decentralized & Governance-minimized</b> ‚Äì Community governed and emphasizing a highly autonomous, algorithmic approach with no active management.  

  * <b>Gasless Transaction Format </b> ‚Äì The platform features an integrated swapping platform that enables users to easily convert other popular tokens to the native token in a gasless transaction format, reducing the complexity of transactions and making the platform more accessible to a wider audience.
  
   * <b>P2P Exchange System</b> ‚Äì Users can exchange their native tokens for other less popular tokens using a peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange system.

  * <b>One Token</b> ‚Äì Genesis Ignite (GIT) is the stablecoin targeting a tight band around $1/coin. Genesis Ignite Token (GIT) is the governance token which accrues fees, seigniorage revenue, and excess collateral value.

  * <b> NFT-based Incentives </b> ‚Äì The platform incentivizes users to actively participate by issuing NFTs based on their level of activeness and trade volume on the platform, creating a gamified experience for users and encouraging them to continue using the platform.
